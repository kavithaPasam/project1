  <h2> Economic Tribal Welfare </h2>
  <p>
	In India, the tribal population has historically been 
	marginalized and excluded from mainstream economic development.
	To address this issue, the government of India has implemented several economic schemes 
	and programs for the welfare of tribal communities.
