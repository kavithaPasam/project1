  <h2>TRIBAL WELFARE</h2>
  <p>Tribal welfare in India refers to the measures taken by the government to improve the lives of
 the tribal communities who constitute a significant proportion of the population in certain regions of the country.
 These communities are often marginalized and face various challenges such as poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and discrimination.

The government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting tribal welfare, including the Tribal 
Sub-Plan (TSP) which allocates funds for the development of tribal areas, the Forest Rights Act which grants land rights
 to tribal communities, and the Integrated Tribal Development Program (ITDP) which aims to improve the socio-economic 
conditions of tribal communities.

Despite these initiatives, challenges remain in ensuring the welfare of tribal communities in India. Some of the key 
issues include inadequate implementation of policies, insufficient funding, and lack of participation of tribal communities in decision-making processes.

Efforts to address these challenges and improve the welfare of tribal communities in India are ongoing, with a
 focus on empowering these communities and ensuring their rights are respected and protected.</p>
